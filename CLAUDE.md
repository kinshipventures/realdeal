# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Output Rules

- Answer is always line 1. Reasoning comes after, never before.
- No preamble, no "Great question!", "Sure!", "Of course!", "Certainly!", "Absolutely!".
- No hollow closings. No "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if you need anything!".
- No restating the prompt. If the task is clear, execute immediately.
- No explaining what you are about to do. Just do it.
- No unsolicited suggestions. Do exactly what was asked, nothing more.
- Structured output only: bullets, tables, code blocks. Prose only when explicitly requested.
- Compress responses. Every sentence must earn its place.
- No redundant context. Do not repeat information already established in the session.

## Typography - ASCII Only

- No em dashes - use hyphens instead.
- No smart/curly quotes - use straight quotes instead.
- No ellipsis character - use three plain dots instead.
- No Unicode bullets - use hyphens or asterisks instead.
- Do not modify content inside backticks.

## Accuracy

- Never speculate about code, files, or APIs you have not read.
- If referencing a file or function: read it first, then answer.
- If unsure: say "I don't know." Never guess confidently.
- Never invent file paths, function names, or API signatures.
- If a user corrects a factual claim: accept it as ground truth for the entire session.

## Code

- Return the simplest working solution. No over-engineering.
- No abstractions or helpers for single-use operations.
- No speculative features or future-proofing.
- No docstrings or comments on code that was not changed.
- Inline comments only where logic is non-obvious.
- Read the file before modifying it. Never edit blind.

## Scope

- Do not add features beyond what was asked.
- Do not refactor surrounding code when fixing a bug.
- Do not create new files unless strictly necessary.
- No safety disclaimers unless there is a genuine life-safety or legal risk.
- No "Note that...", "Keep in mind that..." soft warnings.
- User instructions always override this file.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # start dev server
pnpm build        # type-check + vite build
pnpm lint         # eslint

# Data scripts (require .env.local)
pnpm seed:lists   # seed Lists table in Airtable
pnpm seed:csv     # import service providers CSV into Airtable
```

## Environment

`.env.local` requires:
```
VITE_AIRTABLE_TOKEN=pat...
VITE_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app...
```

## Architecture

React app with two views behind a floating pill navigator:
- `/` → `Dashboard` — equity ring, pod health cards, wrapped insight card, birthdays, today's focus, campaigns, overdue queue, dormant cleanup
- `/map` → `OrbMap` — React Flow node graph for visual network exploration

Global overlays: `SearchPalette` (Cmd+K from any view), `ContactDetail` (slide-out panel), `CampaignDetail` (slide-out panel), `ImportPanel` (/import route).

No backend — Airtable is the data layer, accessed directly from the browser via REST.

### Data flow

`src/lib/airtable.ts` is the entire data layer:
- All reads/writes go through `request()` / `fetchAll()` helpers
- `_contactsCache` and `_categoriesCache` are module-level in-memory caches — invalidate with `_contactsCache = null` / `invalidateContactsCache()` after any mutation
- Airtable linked fields return arrays of record IDs — filtering happens client-side (e.g. `getCategories(listId)` fetches all then filters)
- Overdue = no `last_contacted_at` OR last contact > cadence days (defaults to 30)
- `logInteraction()` wraps `createInteraction()` and auto-updates `last_contacted_at` for non-note types
- Campaign functions: `getCampaigns()`, `getCampaignContacts()`, `createCampaign()`, `addContactToCampaign()`, `updateCampaignContactStatus()`, `completeCampaign()` — all with demo mode support
- `_campaignsCache` / `_campaignContactsCache` follow the same stale-while-revalidate pattern as contacts

### Birthdays (`src/lib/birthdays.ts`)

`getUpcomingBirthdays(contacts, pods)` returns contacts with birthdays in the next N days (default 14). Parses month/day from birthday field, rolls year forward if already passed. `formatDaysUntil()` returns "Today" or "Nd".

### Social equity scoring (`src/lib/equity.ts`)

Relationship health scoring system. Each interaction type has a weight (intro=5, meeting=4, call=3, text/email=2, note=0). Scores are 0-100 based on recency-weighted interaction history within a rolling window tied to pod cadence.

- `contactEquityScore()` → individual contact score
- `podEquityScore()` / `overallEquityScore()` → aggregates
- `scoreLabel()` → Thriving (85+), Steady (70+), Cooling (40+), Fading (<40)
- `todaysFocus()` → generates prioritized list of contacts needing attention
- `CADENCE_DAYS` → weekly=7, biweekly=14, monthly=30, quarterly=90

### Pods and categories

"Pods" are the renamed concept for lists (Airtable table is still called "Lists"). A pod groups contacts; categories subdivide pods. The `Pod` type in `types.ts` has `owner`, `is_priority`, and `cadence` fields that drive equity scoring and focus prioritization.

### Orb map (React Flow)

`OrbMap.tsx` manages two views — `'lists'` and `'categories'` — as React Flow node/edge graphs:

- **Home view**: RealDeal hub orb (116px, `moj-center`) at canvas origin, list orbs (96px) in a circle at radius 310, connected via straight edges
- **Category view**: Selected list stays in place, category orbs (64px) arranged around it at radius 230
- Node positions persist to `localStorage` key `realdeal:node-positions:v2` — bump version when default layout changes to invalidate saved positions
- `buildHomeNodes()` / `buildHomeEdges()` build the home graph; `handleListClick()` fetches categories and transitions to category view
- Hub node is `draggable: false` and never has its position persisted

### Solid orb visual system

`SolidOrb.tsx` is the shared orb component used by all map node types. Two-tone gradient with health ring:
- Background: `linear-gradient(135deg, color, shiftColor)` using `POD_SHIFT_COLORS` map
- `POD_SHIFT_COLORS` (exported from `SolidOrb.tsx`) maps each pod's primary hex to a complementary shift color — also used by `PodCard` and `WrappedCard` for gradient consistency
- Optional `healthPercent` prop renders an SVG ring around the orb
- Hover/press interactions use CSS classes (`.orb-interactive`) with CSS custom properties (`--orb-scale`, `--orb-lift`) set inline. JS handlers only update `boxShadow` — never `transform` — because React re-renders will overwrite JS transform mutations

`GlassOrb.tsx` still exists but is legacy — `SolidOrb` is the active component.

### Escape stack (`src/lib/escapeStack.ts`)

Module-level stack for layered Escape key handling (same pattern as Radix UI). Panels and modals push/pop handlers — only the topmost fires. Use `useEscape(stableCallback)` hook; the callback reference must be stable (`useCallback`) or the cleanup removes the wrong entry.

### Component structure

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `App.tsx` | Routes, floating pill nav, background gradient |
| `dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` | Full dashboard: equity ring, pod cards, wrapped, birthdays, focus, overdue, dormant |
| `dashboard/WrappedCard.tsx` | Cycling gradient insight card (people reached, top pod, most connected) |
| `map/OrbMap.tsx` | Canvas, view state, node/edge assembly |
| `map/SolidOrb.tsx` | Shared solid orb component (gradient, health ring, hover) + `POD_SHIFT_COLORS` |
| `map/GlassOrb.tsx` | Legacy glass orb (still exists, not actively used) |
| `map/ListNode.tsx` | 96px orb — navigates into a list |
| `map/CategoryNode.tsx` | 64px orb — opens ContactPanel |
| `map/CreateCategoryNode.tsx` | "+" orb for adding new categories |
| `map/HubNode.tsx (MojNode.tsx)` | 116px hub orb — settings entry point |

| `contacts/ContactDetail.tsx` | Full contact view with interactions |
| `contacts/ContactCard.tsx` | Row inside ContactPanel |
| `contacts/InteractionSection.tsx` | Interaction history and logging |
| `search/SearchPalette.tsx` | Cmd+K command palette — global contact search |
| `campaigns/CampaignDetail.tsx` | Slide-out panel with contact status tracking, search-add, mark complete |
| `campaigns/CampaignCreate.tsx` | Inline campaign creation form (name, type, deadline) |
| `empty/EmptyState.tsx` | Shared empty state with orb icon, heading, optional CTA |
| `import/ImportPanel.tsx` | Browser-based CSV import UI |
| `ui.tsx` | Shared primitives: `Spinner`, `Avatar` |

### Design system

See `docs/design-system.md` for the full token set, typography scale, spacing grid, motion curves, and accessibility checklist.

Key tokens:
- Background: `#F5F4F0`
- Panel: `rgba(245,244,240,0.88)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(32px)`
- Text primary: `rgba(0,0,0,0.82)`, secondary: `rgba(0,0,0,0.45)`, tertiary: `rgba(0,0,0,0.28)`
- Body font: DM Sans, weights 300/400/500/600
- Display serif: Fraunces (`var(--font-serif)`), weights 400/700/800/900 — used for section headings, pod card names, Wrapped card stats

### Demo mode (`src/lib/sampleData.ts`)

Toggle via "demo on/off" button in nav. When active, all airtable.ts functions return static sample data instead of hitting the API. Includes 6 pods, 14 categories, 21 contacts, 41 interactions, 3 campaigns, and 12 campaign-contact records. Write operations (create campaign, add contact, toggle status) mutate the exported arrays in-place — reset on page refresh.

### Stale files

`supabase/` directory and any Supabase references are stale — the project switched to Airtable. Do not use or restore them.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming -> invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors -> invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR -> invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs -> invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff -> invoke review
- Update docs after shipping -> invoke document-release
- Weekly retro -> invoke retro
- Design system, brand -> invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish -> invoke design-review
- Architecture review -> invoke plan-eng-review
